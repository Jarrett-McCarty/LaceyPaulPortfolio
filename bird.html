            <p>For this mock-up marketing 
                and advertising campaign, my team wanted consumers to view Bird electric scooters as their go-to ride regardless of where they’re going or what they’re doing. Our research found that our target audience wants alternative ways 
                of transportation that’s quick 
                and efficient while avoiding the dreaded fast-walking sweat. This lead to our big idea and overall marketing campaign:

            <p id="one">I created this logo with a sans serif font for a modern feel that catered to Bird’s target market of 18-24 year olds. I also took inspiration from wings of a bird on both the “b” and “d” 
                to create a memorable logo.

                We designed two 3-page fold out print ads that reflected Bird’s target market, i.e. the busy millennial who’s always on the go. These ads reflect our big idea, “Don’t sweat the ride,” by illustrating everything that Rachel and Greg are sweating then showing them looking their best. They’re not sweating 
                their ride because they decided to make Bird their go-to ride.

                We created an OOH advertisement that featured sweat towels that said, “Don’t sweat the ride,” with a call to action to download the Bird app and get your first ride free. 
                These sweat towels would be handed out in gyms, recreation centers, and sporting events around the country during the warmer months where Bird scooters are located.

                We decided to hold a PR Event at the end 
                of a University of Missouri football game where we’d give away our sweat towels in Mizzou’s black and gold. These PR Events could also 
                be held at other college’s sporting events 
                in the university’s school colors.

                I designed and created all OOH content.
